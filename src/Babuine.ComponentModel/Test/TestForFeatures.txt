In this document I will write some scenarios that should be checked.  Until I
use a clearer nomenclature for the tests I will need this document.

SCENARIO:
	
	- Instead of distinguish between simple and recursive scenario, I will
	  test the recursive, because recursive contains the simple scenario.

	* Injection.- We should add 3 recursive levels for
	ensure quality.

		* Injection by field in all levels.
			* Injection by type
			* Injection by instance

		* Injection by constructor in all levels.
			* Injection by type
			* Injection by instance
	
		* Mixed injection combining field / constructor.

		* Mixed injection with attributes and assembler.
			* This will tests also the prevalence for assembler settings.

		* Mixed Injection in all levels mixed unique instance and non-unique.
			* This will also tests the prevalence for the assembler settings.
		* Mixed Injection in all levels with unique instance attributes.

		* Mixed Injection selecting among implementations with attributes.

		* An external source of objects:
			* DBus via NDesk Managed DBus.

	* Wiring:
		
		* Test for exceptions passing incorrect parameters.
			* Ex: Passing a type that isn't an inteface ...
